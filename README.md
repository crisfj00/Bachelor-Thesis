# EASYERASMUS

The main goal of the present project is to develop a web app to ease Erasmus studentsâ€™ experiences, whenever they would like to know what is happening in their destinations.

As a result, a completely working web app will be deployed, where students and Erasmus associations have a centralized software to post and see activities in their destination cities.

Besides, users will be able to participate in events, subscribe to associations and, on
top of that, completely manage these in the same place.
